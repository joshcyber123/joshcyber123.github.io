2. Run an nmap scan on the host:
![[Pasted image 20240205173906.png]]

â”Œâ”€â”€(kaliã‰¿kali)-[~]
â””â”€$  sudo nmap -sC -sV 10.10.11.254
[sudo] password for kali:

â””â”€$ 

3. Added the ip with the corresponding name in the /etc/hosts file:

4. Visited skylab.htb in the browser:
![Pasted image 20240205174449](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e7abea0-c1a1-4008-8f79-fa34324fdf2a)


5. viewed the source code to see if we can anything. So we happen to find this URL while reviewing the code:

![Pasted image 20240205175505](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/309c9d41-7fd2-417d-bc4e-2780636221d9)


6. We will also add the URL to our /etc/hosts file:

7. Navigated to the site:

![Pasted image 20240205175755](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff492249-93b6-4b46-970b-4ea3d4d5764b)


![Pasted image 20240205180016](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e361b93-caa1-40f8-88aa-ac98530b55f0)


9. So, we try to use the username and password to login for a demo as provided on the form:

![Pasted image 20240205180203](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/670fdb2e-4c64-482d-965e-469a80ef52c4)


10. After clicking on MimIO Metrics tab, I got this:

![Pasted image 20240205182739](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34728722-cc1b-4425-a4b7-e43d7ec5c89d)


11. So, I went ahead to enter this %0a and got the following result page:
    http://demo.skyfall.htb/metrics%0a

![Pasted image 20240205184040](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5629d1e2-31f2-49ee-bf84-a7d48966b74f)


Notice on the last line a URL for demo.skylab.htb

![Pasted image 20240205185625](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fe909ca-d1aa-4134-8d5f-c8e39a18f2a8)


11. Added this to the /etc/hosts file:

![Pasted image 20240205185448](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d88bc0ff-06ac-4825-800a-4b8342364800)


12. I decided to visit this page for a potential Mimio CVE on github:

![Pasted image 20240205190652](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8af3fdbe-8c5c-424d-bf80-7722b5ed649d)


13. Clicking on CVE-3035-28432.py exploit to view the script:

![Pasted image 20240205191747](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afd533a5-d225-446e-9a48-27627be66d3f)

14. Launched Burpsuite and copy the URL to the browse saved in the /etc/hosts file prd23-s3-backend.skyfall.htb/:

![Pasted image 20240205192226](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d47fc6f1-e78b-4141-8d6f-16e972cc5a4b)


15. Now, go back to the resporsitory and get the target URL as highlighted earlier:

![Pasted image 20240205194154](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/525970c0-ad4b-44f4-bc2a-2b9aca44cada)


16. In Burpsuite I am able to manipulate the request in Repeater tab and Send it back to the server:

![Pasted image 20240205221331](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36cb4d1a-312e-4ab1-bf96-868d4dff15c3)


We can see the MINIO ROOT PASSWORD in the response field:

![[Pasted image 20240205221838.png]]

17. Download the Minio client:

![Pasted image 20240205221838](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb169db8-47d9-4be6-8819-f072ed5da7f8)

![Pasted image 20240205223804](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66d43ca5-da87-484a-a61b-2e6436481c83)

18. Added the myminio alias for your MinIO server using the `mc` command. Now I can proceed with MinIO client operations on the MinIO server using this alias:

![Pasted image 20240205230816](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/781d3d1c-e170-446c-a7aa-b675fdf7f911)

20. Copy the backup file from Mimio server t:

![Pasted image 20240205232447](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf462b62-85b2-4e80-bf8b-2b01622deb08)

22. Add the Vault api to the /etc/hosts file together with the other 10.10.11.254 URLs

23. Download the vault client:

kali@kali:~$  wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/vault/1.15.5/vault_1.15.5_linux_amd64.zip

kali@kali:~$  unzip vault_1.15.5_linux_amd64.zip

26. Run the command to help SSH into the system via Vault:

![Pasted image 20240206011039](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54e34747-ff0c-4725-b8d8-55791fd85122)


27. Listing the files in the user's home directory we could see the user flag and view it:

![Pasted image 20240206011435](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f152744f-f4ce-4cf2-9eea-e7ed90f80707)

30. Now, viewing the contents of the file:

![Pasted image 20240206020641](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7d7f703-8cfe-4e7c-9efb-f3cfd487e3bb)
