Let's get started...

### Steps
1.  **Start your vpn**
	Go to the directory where your downloaded vpn and start the vpn as shown below
	

2. Run a scan with nmap:

3. So, after the nmap scan, i made some research due to being overwhelmed with so much ports and not knowing which one to start with. I found out about **Port 5222 (Jabber/XMPP)** which is an instant messaging protocol.

This might help us to find custom or default credentials that can be used to authenticate, or there could be interesting information exchanges happening over this protocol.

So, we can go ahead and explore the Jabber/XMPP service for potential chat logs, misconfigurations, or use it as an entry point if credentials can be obtained.

5. The IP was not resolving so I had to add it to the /etc/hosts but still wasn't resolving:

6. Next, thing was to install Pidgin which is a messaging client for Jaber/XMPP:

14. Next, we'll extract the names from the saved xml file

17. Since, it showed one password was cracked we have to reveal it from the output:

22. After clicking on the Join button, we were able to access the chat room. In the chat, I saw the cracked password for svc_openfire:

23. Got an encoded powershell reverse shell from this site and setup a listener using the same IP and port number:

![Pasted image 20240227161538](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb57bd79-9444-415d-ac72-c66d1c9a13de)

24. Next, i entered in the encoded command into the dcompexec command:


But had some issues with impacket due to out of date, so i installed another one using another method:
